# Credit-Risks-EDA
In this project I anlysed dataset on Credit Risk to determine petterns of clients who are potential defaulters on paying the installments. The patterns identified on this project can be used to reduced risks on lending clients whom are identified as High Risk and can potential defaults on paying back the loan, who to reject and approve the loan, and who to get higher interest rate. This will ensure risks are lowered and approve loans to clients who are capable of repaying the loan, which can accellerate the growth of the business, since the business now know who to target for such products.
